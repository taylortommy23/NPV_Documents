Standard Operating Procedure for Network Topology
Purpose:
To establish a consistent and effective approach to managing, documenting, and maintaining the network topology, ensuring optimal performance, reliability, and security.
Scope:
This SOP applies to all network devices and connections within the organization's infrastructure.
Responsibilities:
Network Administrator: Responsible for implementing, maintaining, and enforcing this SOP.
IT Staff: Responsible for following the procedures outlined in this SOP.
Procedures:
Documentation:
Create and maintain a comprehensive network topology diagram, accurately depicting the physical and logical arrangement of devices and connections.
Use a visual network mapping tool to generate and update the diagram regularly.
Include clear labels for devices, IP addresses, subnets, VLANs, and other relevant information.

Discovery and Inventory:
Regularly employ network scanning and discovery tools to detect new devices, changes in connections, and potential vulnerabilities.
Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all network devices, including manufacturer, model, serial number, firmware version, location, and status.
Change Management:
Implement a formal change management process for any modifications to the network topology.
Require documentation, approval, and testing for all proposed changes.
Schedule changes during off-peak hours to minimize disruptions.
Communicate changes to affected users in advance.
Monitoring and Troubleshooting:
Use network monitoring tools to collect performance metrics, identify potential issues, and troubleshoot problems proactively.
Configure alerts for critical events, such as device failures, link outages, or security breaches.
Establish a structured troubleshooting process to quickly isolate and resolve network issues.
Security:
Implement security measures to protect the network topology from unauthorized access, attacks, and data breaches.
Restrict physical access to network devices and wiring closets.
Enforce strong password policies for device access.
Regularly update firmware and software patches.
Conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing.
Implement network segmentation to isolate sensitive areas.
Review and Updates:
Review this SOP annually or as needed to reflect changes in network infrastructure, technologies, or best practices.
Ensure all IT staff are aware of and adhere to the procedures.
Compliance:
Failure to follow this SOP may result in network instabilities, outages, security risks, and non-compliance with regulatory requirements.
